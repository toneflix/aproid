        <p>
          <strong>The short version:</strong> Aproid moves information between devices that you own and pair yourself.
          It does not send that information to us or to anyone else. If you buy Aproid, we keep your email address and
          the list of computers you use it on, so your licence works. No advertising and no analytics.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        This policy explains how the Aproid apps for Android, macOS and Windows (together, &quot;Aproid&quot;) handle
        information. Aproid is made by {site.legalEntity} (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;). If you have a question,
        write to us at <a href={`mailto:${site.contactEmail}`}>{site.contactEmail}</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>1. How Aproid works</h2>
      <p>
        You install Aproid on your phone and on your computer, and pair them by confirming the same code on both
        screens. After that, the paired devices connect to each other directly over your local network, over Bluetooth,
        or through a hotspot from your phone. Every connection is encrypted with TLS, using a certificate each device
        creates for itself. Devices you have not paired cannot read anything Aproid sends.
      </p>
      <p>
        With FlyyDrop you can also send files or links to a nearby device you have not paired. That device is asked
        first and receives only what its owner accepts. You choose whether others can FlyyDrop to you: only your
        paired devices (the default), everyone for 10 minutes, or everyone. To be found, every Aproid device shows its
        name to other Aproid devices on the same network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing you send between your devices passes through servers run by us or by anyone else. The only account is
        the one for your licence, described in section 5.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information Aproid accesses</h2>
      <p>
        Aproid only accesses information for the features you choose to use, and only after you grant the matching
        Android permission. You can turn any of them off at any time in Aproid or in your phone&apos;s settings.
      </p>
      <div className="table-scroll">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Permission</th>
              <th>What it is used for</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            {permissions.map(([name, use]) => (
              <tr key={name}>
                <td>{name}</td>
                <td>{use}</td>
              </tr>
            ))}
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>3. Where your information goes</h2>
      <p>
        Information accessed through these permissions is sent only to the devices you have paired with Aproid, over
        an encrypted connection, so they can show it to you. It is not sent to us, sold, shared with third parties, or
        used for advertising, profiling or any purpose other than the feature you are using. When you FlyyDrop, only the
        files or links you pick go to the one device you choose, after its owner accepts them.
      </p>
      <p>Aproid also speaks the open KDE Connect protocol, so you can pair it with KDE Connect on other devices. Anything you share with a device you pair is handled by the app on that device.</p>

      <h2>4. What is stored, and for how long</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>On every device:</strong> a device name and identifier, the encryption certificate, the list of
          devices you have paired, and your settings. These stay until you unpair a device or uninstall Aproid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Files and photos you send or download</strong> are saved where you can see them (for example your
          Downloads folder) and stay until you delete them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notifications, messages, call details and location</strong> are shown on your computer while you
          use Aproid. The computer apps keep them in memory and in your operating system&apos;s notification centre,
          and do not upload them anywhere.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Your licence</h2>
      <p>The Android app is free and never contacts us. The Mac and Windows apps need a licence after a 14-day trial.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Trial.</strong> When the trial starts, the computer app sends us a one-way scrambled code made from
          your computer&apos;s hardware ID, so the trial can&apos;t simply be restarted. We can&apos;t work out the
          hardware ID from it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Buying.</strong> Paddle.com sells Aproid for us as the merchant of record. Paddle handles your
          payment details, address and tax under{" "}
          <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy">its own privacy policy</a>. We receive your email address and
          the order number, and keep them for as long as your licence exists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Signing in.</strong> To sign in on the website or a computer, we email you a short code, sent through
          SendPulse. The code expires after 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your computers.</strong> For each computer you sign in on, we keep its name, whether it is a Mac or
          PC, the scrambled hardware code, and when it was added and last checked its licence. The app checks in about
          once a day, which shares your IP address with Cloudflare, who host our website. You can see and remove your
          computers on the <a href="/account">account page</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Services Aproid contacts on the internet</h2>
      <p>Apart from the licence, Aproid works without an internet connection. A few optional features contact outside services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Updates.</strong> The Mac and Windows apps check our website for new versions of Aproid. This
          shares your IP address and app version with Cloudflare, who host it. Android updates come through Google Play
          or the file you downloaded.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maps.</strong> When you look up your phone&apos;s location on your computer, the map is drawn by
          Apple Maps on a Mac and by OpenStreetMap on Windows. The map provider receives the area being shown so it
          can send map images. On Windows, opening the location in your browser uses Google Maps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Google Play.</strong> If you install Aproid from Google Play, Google handles the download and may
          collect information under its own privacy policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Children</h2>
      <p>
        Aproid is a general purpose tool and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
        information from children.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Revoke any permission in your phone&apos;s settings. The matching feature simply stops working.</li>
        <li>Unpair a device in Aproid to stop it from connecting and remove its certificate.</li>
        <li>Uninstall Aproid to remove everything it stored on that device.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To get a copy of your licence details or have them deleted, write to us from the email you bought with.
        If you have a question about your rights under laws such as the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023, the GDPR or the CCPA, contact us and we will help.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Security</h2>
      <p>
        Connections between paired devices are encrypted and authenticated with each device&apos;s own certificate.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        If we change how Aproid handles information, we will update this page and the date at the top. Significant
        changes will also be mentioned in the app&apos;s release notes.

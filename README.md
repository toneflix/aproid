## Get it

Download from [aproid.toneflix.com](https://aproid.toneflix.com/#download), and [buy a lifetime licence](https://aproid.toneflix.com/buy) for your computers.

| | Needs | How it installs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Android** | Android 8.0 or later | APK, Google Play coming soon |
| **Mac** | macOS 13 Ventura or later | Signed app, updates itself |
| **Windows** | Windows 10 (1809) or later | Installer, updates itself |

### Setting up

1. Put your phone and computer on the same Wi-Fi, or join your phone's hotspot.
2. Open FlyyLink on both.
3. Tap **Pair** and check the code matches.
4. On the phone, allow notification access and any extras you want.

If the connection drops when the phone is idle (common on Tecno, Infinix, itel and Xiaomi), let FlyyLink run in the background in your battery settings.

Close KDE Connect while setting up; both use the same network port.

## For developers

FlyyLink is three native apps sharing one protocol.

| Folder | What's inside |
| --- | --- |
| `android/protocol` | The protocol in plain Kotlin: packets, identity, pairing, discovery. |
| `android/app` | The Android app (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose). |
| `macos/Sources/FlyyLinkKit` | The protocol in Swift. |
| `macos/Sources/FlyyLink` | The Mac menu bar app (SwiftUI). |
| `windows/src/FlyyLink.Core` | The protocol in C#. |
| `windows/src/FlyyLink` | The Windows tray app (WinUI 3). |
| `web` | The website (Next.js). |
| `branding` | The logo and the scripts that generate every app icon. |
| `docs` | [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md), [releasing](docs/RELEASING.md), [licences](docs/LICENCES.md), [website hosting](docs/WEBSITE.md) and the [Windows app](docs/WINDOWS.md). |

**Android** (JDK 17 and the Android SDK):

```sh
cd android
./gradlew :protocol:test        # protocol tests, no Android SDK needed
./gradlew :app:installDebug     # build and install on a connected phone
```

**Mac** (Xcode 15 or later):

```sh
cd macos
swift test
./scripts/bundle.sh             # builds macos/build/FlyyLink.app
open build/FlyyLink.app
```

Run it as a bundle, or notifications and the Share menu won't work.

**Windows** (.NET 8 SDK, and Windows for the app itself):

```sh
cd windows
dotnet test tests/FlyyLink.Core.Tests    # runs on any OS
```

See [windows/README.md](windows/README.md) for building the app and the installer, and [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md) for what it does.

**Website** (Node 20 or later):

```sh
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Releasing

Push a tag like `1.2.3` to release all three apps, or `android-1.2.3`, `macos-1.2.3`, `windows-1.2.3` for one. See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for the secrets and where the files go.
